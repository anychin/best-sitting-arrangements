The first line specifies the dimensions of the plane. The first digit is the
number of seats in a row and the second digit is the number of rows on the plane.

Each subsequent line describes a group of travellers. For example, the first
line of travelers describes a group of three where the first traveller has a
preference for a window seat. Each number uniquely identifies the traveller
on the flight.
